# DrkGPT-EXT
DrkGPT uses the GPT 3.1 API to generate an answer to your question. 
DrkGPT writes it for you. Teachers wont see the copy pasting! Now as a browser extension!

Teachers nowadays use draftback to see if you copy or pasted. DrkGPT writes the essay for you at a designated speed, pausing now and then making your writing more trustworthy.
